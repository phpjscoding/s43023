Spain is a beautiful country with diverse landscapes and plenty of attractions to explore. While many visitors rely on public transportation, renting a car can be a great way to see more of the country at your own pace. However, driving in Spain can be different than what you're used to, especially if you're from a country with different driving rules and regulations. In this article, we'll go over what you need to know before renting a car in Spain to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip.

## Know the rules of the road

In Spain, people drive on the right-hand side of the road. It's important to remember this when you're driving, especially when turning at intersections. The speed limit on highways is typically 120 km/h, but it can vary depending on the region and the type of road. In cities, the speed limit is usually around 50 km/h.

It's also important to note that the blood alcohol limit in Spain is 0.05%, so if you plan on drinking, make sure you have a designated driver or take public transportation.

## Get an international driver's license

If you're from outside the EU, you'll need an international driver's license to rent a car in Spain. This license is basically a translation of your regular driver's license and allows you to drive legally in Spain. You can get an international driver's license from your local automobile association or government agency.

## Choose the right car

When renting a car in Spain, make sure you choose a car that is appropriate for the type of driving you'll be doing. If you're planning on exploring rural areas or mountainous regions, a four-wheel drive or SUV may be a better choice than a smaller car. Additionally, if you're not comfortable driving a manual transmission, make sure you request an automatic when making your rental reservation.

## Get familiar with tolls

Many of Spain's major highways have tolls, and they can add up quickly if you're not careful. It's important to have some cash on hand to pay the tolls or make sure your rental car has a device to pay them automatically. You can also use a credit card to pay tolls, but it's important to check with your bank before you leave to make sure there won't be any issues.

## Know where to park

Finding parking in cities can be a challenge, especially in popular tourist areas. Many cities have underground parking garages, but they can be expensive. Look for street parking, but make sure you check the signs to see if you need to pay for parking or if there are time restrictions. Additionally, never leave any valuables in your car, as break-ins can be a problem in some areas.

In conclusion, renting a car in Spain can be a great way to see the country, but it's important to be prepared. Make sure you know the rules of the road, have an international driver's license, choose the right car, get familiar with tolls, and know where to park. By following these tips, you'll be able to navigate Spanish roads with ease and enjoy all that this beautiful country has to offer.
