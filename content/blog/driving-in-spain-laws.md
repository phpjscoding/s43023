## what you should know when it comes to driving in Spain

Driving in Spain shares many similarities with driving in other European countries when it comes to adhering to rules and regulations. For instance, driving is done on the right-hand side of the road, with overtaking on the left. Those from EU/EFTA countries will likely recognize many of the laws surrounding road safety and vehicle equipment standards. The driving culture in Spain is generally laid-back, and the country boasts one of the lowest rates of fatal road accidents in the European Union.

Spain's car ownership rate is slightly below the EU average, with just over 500 cars per 1,000 inhabitants. In 2019, approximately 1.38 million new cars were purchased, and only slightly more than 3% of them were fueled by electric or green sources. In terms of vehicle emissions, Spain falls behind some of the leading countries in the EU, producing 112.4g of CO2/km in 2020, compared to the EU average of 108.2g. While low emission zones (LEZ) already exist in Spain and Barcelona, other cities such as Sevilla, Valencia, and Valladolid have implemented their own environmental regulations on cars. However, the Spanish congress has recently passed a bill that mandates municipalities with over 50,000 inhabitants to establish a LEZ by 2023.

## What are the requirements for driving in Spain?

### Driving Licenses in Spain
Driving licenses in Spain are issued by the DGT. The licenses are in credit card format and include the holder's photo, signature, as well as other information such as name, date of birth, issue and expiration dates, and a unique license number. The typical validity period of a license is ten years.

### Obtaining a Driving License in Spain
To acquire a Spanish driving license, you must be a resident of Spain and pass a two-part driving test consisting of a written theory test and a practical exam. However, if you are exchanging a foreign license, you must meet the requirements based on the country that issued your license (details are provided below).

### Car registration and maintenance in Spain.

In Spain, a license system based on points is in operation. Typically, drivers begin with 12 points, which are subtracted as the holder violates driving rules. Once a driver reaches zero points, they may face license revocation.In adition to that ,it is mandatory to register all vehicles with the DGT. If you purchase a new car from a dealership, they will usually take care of the registration process for you, or you can also do it yourself online.

If you plan to import a car to Spain, you will need to re-register it. To do so, you must provide proof of ownership and a certificate that confirms that the car meets the minimum road standards, such as the EU Certificate of Conformity. The vehicle must also pass an inspection at a licensed vehicle inspection station (Inspección Técnica de Vehículos – ITV).

For vehicles from the EU/EFTA, providing proof of VAT payment is usually sufficient. However, cars from countries outside the EU may be subject to additional import taxes. Once the registration is complete, you will be issued a registration number and can obtain Spanish license plates. If you want to use an imported car before the registration process is completed, you will receive temporary green license plates.

In Spain, vehicles are required to undergo compulsory ITV maintenance checks at four years of age and then every two years until they reach ten years old. Subsequently, inspections are conducted on an annual basis.

## The cost of driving in SPain

When it comes to using and maintaining a car in Spain, it can be quite expensive. According to the 2021 Car Cost Index, Spain is ranked as the 8th most expensive European country with an average yearly cost of €944. Apart from the initial expenses associated with obtaining a driving license and purchasing or importing a car, you should also take into account the following expenses:

- Car insurance - which on average costs €356 annually in Spain as of 2019
- Taxes - in addition to the one-time registration tax, which can be up to 15% of the car's purchase price and is based on CO2 emissions, there's also an annual road tax called Impuesto Sobre Vehículos de Tracción Mecánica (IVTM), which varies depending on the fuel type of your vehicle and the municipality where you live.
- Fuel costs - at the moment, the cost of petrol is €1.56 per liter, while diesel is €1.45 per liter.
- Maintenance - cars that are at least four years old must undergo an ITV test, which usually costs around €35-40 every two years (or every year for cars over 10 years old).
- Road tolls - motorway tolls in Spain can reach up to around €20-30.

Aside from these, you should also consider general repair and maintenance costs, parking expenses, automobile club memberships, and any fees related to LEZ.



## Rules and Penalties for Driving in Spain
### Overview of Road Rules in Spain
Spain’s Traffic and Road Safety Code (Código de Tráfico y Seguridad Vial) contains detailed information regarding the country’s traffic rules and regulations. Here are some of the essential general rules:

- Overtaking should only be done on the left. Vehicles that are longer than 10 meters or weigh over 3.5 tons must keep a minimum distance of 50 meters from the car in front while driving on main roads.
- All passengers in a vehicle must wear seat belts. Children under the age of 12 are not allowed to sit in the front passenger seat. Any child under 1.35 meters in height must be secured in a child safety seat.
- Vehicles approaching from the right have priority, except for in roundabouts where both vehicles have equal priority.
- In winter, when driving in mountainous areas, it is mandatory to use snow chains.
- The use of car horns is illegal except in cases of emergency, to prevent accidents, or to warn of serious incidents, such as crimes.
- Minor traffic offenses can result in fines of up to €100. If you do not have a Spanish residency permit or NIE number, you are typically required to pay the fine immediately.

When driving, you should always carry the following items in addition to your driver's license, car insurance certificate, and ITV certificate (if required):

- Two warning triangles to be used in the event of a breakdown or accident
- Reflective jacket
- Headlamp beam deflectors
- Spare bulbs for headlights
- Spare tire and puncture repair kit, unless the vehicle is registered outside of Spain
- An extra pair of prescription driving glasses if necessary.

### The speed limits in Spain were updated in 2021, and failure to adhere to them can result in immediate fines or worse. The current speed limits are:

- 30km/h in residential or built-up areas (or 20km/h on roads shared by cars and pedestrians)
- 50km/h on urban roads with two lanes in each direction
- 90km/h on rural roads
- 120km/h on motorways

Penalties for exceeding the speed limit in Spain depend on the severity of the offense. Fines range from €100-600, and if you exceed the limit by at least 20km/h, you will incur a deduction of 2-6 points on your license.

Spain has increased the number of speed radars all over the country in recent years, including both permanent fixed radars and mobile radars used by police or the Guardia Civil.


## parking in Spain 

In many town or city centers in Spain, parking is managed by ticket machines in blue zones, which are identified by blue ticket machines and street markings.

To park in these areas, purchase a ticket from a machine and display it clearly on your dashboard, indicating the hours of validity. Parking may be free during siesta hours, between 2pm and 4pm from Monday to Friday, and after 2pm on Saturdays. Generally, parking is free on Sundays, and tickets usually cost around €1.

Additionally, some cities have other colored zones designated for residents who pay an annual fee. These are resident zones, and parking in these areas is strictly prohibited unless you are a registered resident. Failing to comply will result in a fine.
