# Renting a Car in Spain in 2023: All you need to know

Welcome fellow travelers! Spain is a country that never ceases to amaze. With its breathtaking coastlines, majestic mountains like the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, and charming villages nestled in lush valleys, there's something for everyone to discover in this stunning destination. As a seasoned traveler, I highly recommend renting a car to explore this diverse and captivating country at your own pace.

Although Spain has a well-developed public transportation system, there's no better way to immerse yourself in its rich culture and picturesque scenery than by hitting the road. Whether you're planning a romantic getaway or a family vacation, a rental car gives you the freedom and flexibility to explore off the beaten path and uncover hidden gems that may be missed by others.

But before you hit the road, here's everything you need to know about renting a car in Spain. 

## How to rent a car in Spain

Many travelers are familiar with Spain’s advanced railway and bus systems, however, driving a car is arguably the best way to see the country. Renting a car in Spain gives you the enjoyable freedom to make up your route and follow it at your own pace. Most roads are very well-maintained and reach every corner of the country.

Drive from the mountains to the sea, stopping to visit stunning cities like Barcelona and Valencia in between. Or head into the hills of Andalucia to discover the many beautiful white villages and fairytale-like castles. Whatever it is that you would like to see in Spain, a car makes the perfect transportation method. In this guide, you’ll find exactly how to drive and rent a car in Spain.

## What do you need to rent a car in Spain? 

When you rent a car in Spain, you’ll need to bring the following documents:

- Your driver’s license from your home country
- Your ID (passport) 
- Credit Card in your name
- International Driver’s Permit

The legal driving age in Spain is 18 years old. To be able to rent a car, however, most rental car companies in Spain require you to be at least 21 years old. Some might also ask that you have had your license for at least one year, and some might require you to be 23 or over. All drivers must present a valid driver’s license, an ID as proof of their identity, and a credit card to make the payment.

Note: Most car rentals in Spain charge an extra fee if you’re under 25 years old. It is also required by law that you hold an International Driver’s Permit if you’re a non-EU citizen driving in Spain. You will be asked to present this to the rental agency, as well as the Spanish police in the event you’re stopped while driving. An International Driver’s Permit costs just 15 USD and is valid for one year. [You can arrange yours here](https://internationaldrivingpermit.org/how-to-apply/)

## Rental car insurance in Spain

When renting a car in Spain, it is required that you have unlimited third-party liability insurance. With most companies, this is typically included in the price of your car rental and will be in the form of a deductible hold on your credit card. Make sure to check if your credit card can cover the costs of this deposit before you rent a car. Additional insurance such as a Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or theft cover is recommended, but not mandatory.

It's recommended to include any extra coverage at the time of making your initial car rental reservation since the prices tend to be most favorable then. Additionally, it's worth verifying whether your credit card policy extends to car rental insurance in Spain. Remember to have your insurance proof, car documents, passport, and IDP with you at all times when driving.

An important tip to keep in mind is to inspect your car for a rental sticker and remove it if present. These stickers have been known to attract theft in Spain.

## Is it easy to drive in Spain?

Before you rent a car in Spain, it’s good to know some of the rules and customs on the road. 

## Road conditions and speed limits

In Spain, much of the country is relatively flat or gradually inclines which makes getting across fast and easy. The roads and motorways are in excellent condition and typically don’t have much traffic, leaving room for you to enjoy the surroundings.

On a road trip through Spain, you’ll often find yourself driving next to beautiful flowers or over high bridges, perched in between the mountains. Outside of major cities like Madrid or Barcelona, it’ll get busier but it remains easy to drive around.

 ![Street music in the cathedral square](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529068726703-d4dfa1c99b99?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1169&q=80)

When traveling on motorways in Spain, also known as autopistas and autovías, it's imperative to observe the speed limit of 120 km/h. Autopistas are toll roads marked with the letters "AP," while Autovías (indicated by "A") are free highways that run parallel to the Autopistas. It's essential to keep in mind the speed limit as the roads are monitored by the national guard and police. On main roads, the speed limit varies between 80 km/h to 100 km/h. In urban areas, the speed limit is either 50 or 70 km/h. Be sure to pay attention to traffic signs and adhere to the specified speed limits.

## Tolls & Offline maps

Even though Spain does have a few toll roads, on some Autopistas (AP) and radial roads (R), they’re significantly less common than in the neighboring countries Portugal or France. These roads are typically ones that go through mountain tunnels or involve another form of engineering and, therefore, require more maintenance.

When you opt for one of these roads, you can pay the toll in cash, by credit card, or with the electronic device Via-T. The toll routes in Spain typically cost between 5 and 30 EUR depending on the distance you travel on the route and the location of the Autopista. 

![Barcelona, Spain,steep street](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1658329699942-ab19ead9b476?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=464&q=80)

Any navigation device or map app will have toll booths marked and can give you the option to avoid these roads. A GPS or offline Google Maps is recommended, as the connection in Spain is not great. Try to load the route on your app before leaving a WiFi zone or driving with mobile data. 

> *Tip*: Some of the toll roads take you past fantastic landscapes, which make up for the 5 – 10 EUR fee. For example, between Granada and Malaga you’ll cross a suspension bridge that overlooks the beautiful mountains in the area.

## Traffic in Spain

Large cities like Barcelona often experience traffic congestion, making it advisable to avoid driving during peak hours. Spain has four rush hours (horas puntas) due to the traditional afternoon break, but traffic can be heavy throughout the day. In certain cities like Madrid, vehicles are prohibited from entering the historic center to curb pollution.

> A helpful tip when visiting larger cities in Spain is to park your car outside the central area and rely on public transportation instead. The urban public transport network, which includes metros, tramways, and buses, is quite reliable. Additionally, taking public transportation tends to be less expensive since parking rates tend to increase as you approach the city center.

Apart from its stunning towns and villages, Spain boasts impressive mountain ranges such as the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada. While most mountain roads are well-maintained, it's recommended to exercise caution while driving. If you're planning to visit Spain's mountains during the winter, snow chains may be necessary for your vehicle. When renting a car in Spain, it's advisable to inquire about snow chains at the rental agency.

## Top tips for renting a car in Spain

### 1. Do a walk around and check the car

When you pick up your rental car in Spain, make sure to do a walk around and check if everything’s there. If you’re traveling in winter and headed for the mountainous regions, see if there are snow tires on the car or snow chains in the trunk. 

![Galicia, Spain](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1653814601465-bf169e5388ab?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1170&q=80)

When renting a car in Spain, you'll be required to sign a check-out form. It's essential to inspect the vehicle for any scratches or damages, which are not uncommon in Spain, and verify if they're noted on the form. If they're not, ensure that the rental agency employee acknowledges and documents them before you sign the check-out form. The form will also indicate the car's mileage and fuel level at the time of pickup.

To ensure that everything is properly documented, consider taking photos or videos of any damages noted on the rental car, the fuel level in the tank, and the car's previous mileage. This way, you'll have a record of the car's condition at the time of pickup, which can be useful if any disputes arise later.

### 2. Opt for a smaller rental car

It's recommended to choose a smaller car when renting a vehicle in Spain unless you require a significant amount of space or intend to drive in the mountains. This is because many Spanish streets are narrow, parking spaces tend to be small, and gas prices are relatively high. If the rental agency suggests upgrading to a larger car, it's best to decline the offer.

One of the reasons why Spain's urban areas are so enchanting is that most of them have existed for centuries. Like its neighboring countries, Portugal and France, Spain's rich history is still evident, with many towns and villages having narrow cobblestoned roads. These roads can be challenging to navigate, so it's advisable to have an up-to-date navigation system and to follow the road signs carefully.

### 3. Watch your parking

Finding a parking spot in the urban areas of Spain can be difficult, particularly in the historic centers, and the regulations can differ from one part of the city to another. On-street paid parking is identifiable by blue lines on the pavement, and you'll need to purchase a ticket from a nearby machine. Resident parking spots are designated by green markings or a black sign with the letter 'P' on it. Street parking is usually free on national holidays, Sundays, and after 7 PM in most urban areas, but it's essential to verify this to avoid any penalties.

It should be noted that, similar to Italy, some drivers in Spain appear to be unconcerned about minor scratches on their cars. It is not unusual to see drivers nudging other cars out of the way to find a suitable parking space. It is important to be cautious when parking and avoid leaving any valuables or personal belongings in plain sight inside the car, as theft from rental cars can occur.

> When parking on the streets in certain areas of Spain, especially in the southern region, you may come across unofficial helpers who offer to assist with parking your car. It is important to note that they are not official employees and may request 1-2 EUR for their services. It is advisable to pay them to avoid any potential damage to your vehicle.

### 4. Fill your car with the right fuel

You can easily locate gas stations throughout Spain with the help of Google Maps or other navigation services. The average cost of fuel in Spain is around 1.90 EUR per liter (7.20 EUR per gallon), and you can choose between diesel (diesel) or unleaded (gasolina). When refilling your rental car, it's important to pay close attention to the names of the fuel types in Spain, as gasoline is referred to as gasolina, and diesel is sometimes known as gasóleo.

![Ones in Barcelona](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519749211472-462fee22a2a0?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1176&q=80)

Gas stations in Spain are usually self-service, but during the day there is usually an attendant who can assist you if you have any questions. If you are unsure about which type of fuel your rental car requires, look for a sticker in the car that provides this information. The sticker can typically be found on the fuel door, dashboard, or car key. Gas stations are available in rural areas, small towns, big cities, and along the highways.

 > In Spain, gas stations may occasionally be unstaffed, particularly on Sundays, holidays, during lunchtime siestas, or late at night. If you find yourself driving during these periods, the only available gas stations may be automated and may only accept card payments.

 ## How much does a car rental in Spain cost?

Renting a car in Spain is usually affordable. The cost is determined by factors such as the season you visit, the length of your trip, and the type of car you choose. Rental prices tend to be higher during the summer months due to increased demand. On the other hand, prices are lower during other seasons, including winter. The total cost is also influenced by the length of your rental period. Renting a car for a longer duration can lower the daily price, which means that 5 days of rental may cost only slightly more than 3 days. If possible, consider exploring Spain for at least a week to make the most of your rental car.

## Getting the right vehicle

In numerous European countries, a common principle is that smaller cars have lower prices compared to bigger ones since they consume less fuel. Choosing a compact car can also be advantageous when navigating narrow roads or bustling cities. If you're considering renting an automatic car in Spain, bear in mind that these are uncommon and more expensive than manual cars.

Browse your options online via a comparison site to make sure you get the best deal. If you book in advance, it’ll be much more affordable than stepping into the office and arranging it there

 >Before booking a car, it is advisable to check the rental conditions. Various points such as the mileage policy can have an impact on the overall cost of your rental car.

## Where do I rent a car in Spain?

There are many reputable car rental companies in Spain to select from. If you're planning on renting a car during the summer months, it's recommended to make arrangements in advance. Booking in advance ensures that you can obtain the desired car type, potentially at a lower price.

Consider choosing different cities for car pick-up and drop-off if it fits your route. Several car rental companies in Spain provide one-way rentals, offering you the flexibility to explore the country without the obligation to return the vehicle to the original location. This may sometimes come at no additional cost and is otherwise worthwhile, taking into account fuel, time, and possible tolls. Upon returning the car, ensure that you are aware of whether it is necessary to refuel and that someone checks the car for any damage while you are still present.

Are you interested in exploring more of Europe with the same rental car? You'll be glad to know that some car rental companies offer one-way international travel options. This means that you can visit neighboring countries such as France or Portugal without having to return to Spain. Before making your booking, check with the rental company to see if this option is available and what the requirements are.
